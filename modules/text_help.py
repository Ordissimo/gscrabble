TEXT_HOW_PLAY += '\n'+_('''Scrabble is a fun, classic word game. The object of the game is to get the most points by playing words on a board that you connect to words created by your fellow players. To play Scrabble, you need at least one other player. You will also need an official Scrabble board with all of its components. As you play the game, you create words, rack up points, challenge your opponents, and even exchange tiles if yours are not working for you. All the while, a scorekeeper tallies up each player’s points to determine who will win at the end of the game. If you become a fan of the game, you may consider inviting your friends to join you on a regular basis, joining a club, or entering a tournament.''')
TEXT_HOW_PLAY += '\n'+_('''1- Make sure that you have everything you need to play Scrabble:''')
TEXT_HOW_PLAY += '\n'+_('''Before you begin your game, make sure that you have everything that you need to play Scrabble. You will need a game board, 100 letter tiles, one letter rack for each player, and a cloth bag to hold the letter tiles. You will also need 1-3 other people to play with.''')
TEXT_HOW_PLAY += '\n'+_('''2- Choose a dictionary to use for challenges:''')
TEXT_HOW_PLAY += '\n'+_('''It is possible that during the course of your game, someone will play a word that another player believes is invalid. In a situation like this, you will need to look up the word in a dictionary. Make sure that you have a dictionary or a mobile device with a Scrabble checker app on hand to deal with challenges.''')

TEXT_HOW_PLAY += '\n'+_('''To make sure that the letters are distributed fairly, put them into the bag, close it, and shake them around a bit.''')

TEXT_HOW_PLAY += '\n'+_('''Pass the bag around the table and allow each player to draw one tile. Then, place your tiles face up on the table.

The word must use at least two tiles and it must be placed across the start square in the center of the board. The word can be laid out in a vertical or horizontal fashion, but it cannot be diagonal.
    When calculating the first word score, keep in mind that the player who places the first word gets to double his or her total score because the start square counts as a Premium Square with a double word bonus. For example, if the total value of the first word played was 8, then the player would receive a score of 16.''')

    For example, if you place a word over a square that says “Double Word” on it, then you should double the total value of your word. If you place a tile over a square that says “Double Letter”, then you should double the value of that letter tile only when you calculate your score.''')

    As you build onto the words that your opponents have played, make sure that you consider all of the connected tiles. Your addition to the board must create at least one new word, but if you connect to other tiles, from other directions, then you need to make sure that you are creating valid words with these connections.''')

    Double Letter Score: This means that a letter placed on this square receives double the number of points that are shown on the letter.
    Double Word Score: This means that a word that is made that includes the letter that is placed on this square receives double the number of points that it otherwise would.
    Triple Letter Score: This means that a letter placed on this square receives three times the number of points that are shown on the letter.

You cannot incorporate bonuses from Premium Squares that you already counted in a different turn or that were counted by a different player.
    When adding the bonuses for plays with multiple Premium Squares, add the letter bonuses in before the word bonuses. For example, if you spell a word that has a double letter bonus and a triple word bonus, add the double letter bonus to your total before multiplying the total by three.''')
